## LSTM
LSTM has a very intricate structure in the RNN Universe. However, we will go over it in detail and see the progression of how it learns

We will consider the following input data

``` python
# This is a simple repeated data set
data=np.array([0,1,0,-1,-1,0,1,0,-1,-1,0,1,0,-1,-1,0,1,0,-1,-1])
data=np.array(list(data)*100)
```
