## MongoDB
MongoDB is a very actively used No-SQL database. An advantage of using this is the extensive community that is using it which helps one resolve issues quickly

### Installation
We will be installing MongoDB Community Edition on a Windows machine. The steps are similar for a Linux installation as well

#### Downloading the installer
Go to the link https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community?jmp=docs


``` python
# This is a simple repeated data set
data=np.array([0,1,0,-1,-1,0,1,0,-1,-1,0,1,0,-1,-1,0,1,0,-1,-1])
data=np.array(list(data)*100)
```
