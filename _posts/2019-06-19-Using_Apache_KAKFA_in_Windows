## Apache Kafka
Apache Kafka is an application that is quickly gaining momentum to perform scalable operations between multiple producers and multiple consumers

We will consider the following input data

``` python
# This is a simple repeated data set
data=np.array([0,1,0,-1,-1,0,1,0,-1,-1,0,1,0,-1,-1,0,1,0,-1,-1])
data=np.array(list(data)*100)
```
